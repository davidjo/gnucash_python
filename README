This is an alpha alpha implementation of report writing in python
Three existing reports "functioning" - hello_world example, price_scatter and cash_flow

Functioning means a report page is displayed which can be exported as html.
Coding primarily based on scheme at the moment for testing and comparing to the scheme way
- this is not necessarily the most "pythonic" way

Requirements:

swig
python (currently using 2.7)
python bindings to gtk
python gobject/glib bindings
python elementtree module
gnucash python bindings

Implementation needs 5 compiled modules
- installed in primary gnucash source under src/python in a new subdirectory called plugin
- must be copied to ~/.gnucash/python after compilation

Makefile.wrap defined which is designed to be run in an existing gnucash source
after a full compilation step

to compile: make -f Makefile.wrap release

Three defines required
- PYTHONPREFIX - path to your python installation
- PYTHONVER - python version eg python2.6 for 2.6 version of python
- SWIG - path to your swig binary

At the moment Im using the pre-introspection gobject bindings
(Im on OSX 10.6.8 using macports for primary gnucash installation)

If you wish to modify the wrappings 3 additional utilities are needed from the gobject package
pygobject-codegen-2.0
h2def.py
defsgen.py

HTML output is via python wrappers access to the gnucash webkit output functions
python elementtree module used as document model for HTML output

python modules are designed to be work from a $HOME/.gnucash/python directory
ui files need to be copied into ~/.gnucash/ui directory

modified main gnucash installation share/gnucash/init.py needed which loads
from a local_init.py file installed in ~/.gnucash/python
- after local_init.py loaded all other python modules loaded from ~/.gnucash/python

PRELIMINARY PARTIAL WORKING ONLY!!

only partial implementation of report options
only partial implementation of style tables

modified option saving not working/tested
modified report saving not working/tested
